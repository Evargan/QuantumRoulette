    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration for the game came from Buckshot Roulette, but in our case, it’s just a regular weapon.\n",
    "### 1.1 Classical Buckshot Roulette\n",
    "\n",
    "Buckshot Roulette is a strategic game where two players take turns with a shotgun loaded with a mix of live and blank rounds:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Players can shoot **themselves** (gaining an extra turn if the round is blank)\n",
    "- Players can shoot their **opponent** (turn ends regardless of outcome)\n",
    "- Each player has limited lives\n",
    "- The game continues until one player is eliminated\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Why Quantum?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bullets naturally resemble qubits:\n",
    "- Two states: **live bullet** (|1⟩) and **blank** (|0⟩)\n",
    "- State is unknown until \"measured\" (fired)\n",
    "- Can exist in **superposition** of both states\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding quantum mechanics:\n",
    "- **Superposition**: Bullets can be both live and blank simultaneously\n",
    "- **Entanglement**: Two bullets can be correlated\n",
    "- **Quantum gates**: Players can manipulate probabilities strategically\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Quantum Roulette\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Roulette extends the classical game by introducing quantum mechanics into the bullets:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Each bullet behaves like a qubit, with states |1⟩ (live) and |0⟩ (blank)\n",
    " - Bullets can exist in superposition, so a single bullet can be both live and blank until fired\n",
    " - Bullets can be entangled, creating correlations between rounds that influence outcomes\n",
    " - Players have a set of quantum gates to manipulate bullets, changing probabilities and creating strategies\n",
    " - Turns follow the same rules: shooting themselves or their opponent, with lives tracking survival\n",
    " - The game continues until one player loses all lives"
